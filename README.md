A couple of years ago after learning about standard deviation, I became interested in creating algorithms for image processing.
I began to use python to try and understand the uses of standard deviation in image processing and I was astounded after writing
a couple of toy scripts. I was able to separate the foreground of an image from its background and vice versa. I'll be writing some
docs about how to use these scripts.
